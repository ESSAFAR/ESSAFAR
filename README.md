**HEY THERE** 👋😌


🌳 I'm Mohamed Anwar Es-safar, currently a student at Mohammadia School of Engineers.

🍀 Currently, I'm learning about various tech concepts, such as full-stack development, DevOps, data science, and security. My goal is to build a strong foundation of general knowledge and to quench my thirst for learning new things.

🌱 I'm striving to make a meaningful impact on my community and to give back to society.

🪴 I'm actively seeking interesting projects to contribute to, even if it means learning new technologies or skills from scratch.
