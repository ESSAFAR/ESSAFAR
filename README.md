**HEY THERE** 👋😌


🌳 I'm Mohamed Anwar Es-safar, currently a student at Mohammadia School of Engineers and a proud member of the charity club EMI Khayr and the public speaking club EMI Rhetorica.

🍀 Currently, I'm learning about various CS basics, such as full-stack development, DevOps, data science, and networking. My goal for this year is to build a strong foundation of general knowledge and to quench my thirst for learning new things. I am deeply interested in technology, coding, and math.

🌱 In addition, I'm working on developing my soft skills, such as project management and teamwork, I'm also striving to make a meaningful impact on my community and to give back to society.

🪴 I'm actively seeking interesting projects to contribute to, even if it means learning new technologies or skills from scratch..
