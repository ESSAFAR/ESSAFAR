**HEY THERE** 👋😌


🌳I'm Mohamed Anwar Es-safar
Currently a first year student at Mohammadia School of Engineers, and a proud member of the charity club EMI Khayr.


🍀 I'm currently learning everything I can in CS basics : C, Web dev and Database management systems. Building a strong general knowledge is my goal during this year, I want to fulfill my appetite for learning new things and my deep interest in thechnology, coding and Math.

🌱 I'm also working on my soft skills, managing  projects and team work.

🪴 I'm actively looking for interesting project to contribute to 🙏, even if that I had to learn technologies/skills from the scratch.
